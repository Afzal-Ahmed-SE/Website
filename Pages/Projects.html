                  <h3>Coin Classification based on Image Recognition Using CNN </h3>
                  <p> Automatic ancient coin classification based on pattern recognition is an open research problem. Ancient coins have significant value in culture heritage and originality of coins is imperative for their significance. Furthermore, because significant amounts of coins are transferred on the Internet on a daily basis, so it is essential to promote automatic coin recognition systems to prevent unlawful transactions. Ancient coin categorization is complex due to variety in coin designs, purposes, and their symbol interpretabilities. Vision-based coin-image analysis is drawing growing amount of research as a particularly interesting application in the field of cultural heritage on the one hand, and a technically demanding subject on the other. Here, we present a framework for automatic recognition performed on ancient roman coins. The framework uses hierarchical knowledge structure of coins complemented with CNNbased category classifier. We focus on image enhancement and combination of locally relevant image descriptors for ancient coin recognition. Recognition comprises of feature-based identification of comparable images matching. Points-of-interest are detected and described by local characteristics as their appearance. Experiments for the containment of ancient are presented coin images showing our approach’s practicality. Results are evaluated using the accuracy and precision metrics on Roman Republican Coin Dataset (17546 images) and Roman Coins Dataset (360 Images). Our model outperforms various deep learning methods on this dataset, with a classification accuracy of more than 96%. </p>

                  <h3>Intelligent Sentiment Analysis System Based on Recent Trends of Machine Learning </h3>
                  <p> Social networks are producing data at an ever-growing rate. Social nets are the platforms for conveying opinions (or sentiments) on varying concerns. Sentiment analysis is a way of determining the subjectivity of message/opinion. The sentiment analysis on social nets (like Twitter), assesses the sentiments represented by the users in their tweets with tweets expressing ideas, interests, and opinions in a range of settings. Consequently, Twitter sentiment analysis is a hot research area at present. We aim to concentrate on sentiment analysis on twitter data, which is beneficial for discovering insight into the words used in the tweets, where opinions are strong, unstructured, and have either positive, negative, or neutral influence. Tweets are an amalgam of complex characters and complicated expressions requiring efficacious computation. In this study, we present various algorithm and methodologies employed on Twitter data for sentiment analysis. Here, the goal of sentiment analysis is to gauge or quantify the emotional perspective of the author against a certain issue. </p>

                  <h3>Satellite and Scene Image Classification Based on Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning of Resnet50 </h3>
                  <p> Image classification has gained lot of attention due to its application in different computer vision tasks such as remote sensing, scene analysis, surveillance, object detection, and image retrieval. The primary goal of image classification is to assign the class labels to images according to the image contents. The applications of image classification and image analysis in remote sensing are important as they are used in various applied domains such as military and civil fields. Earlier approaches for remote sensing images and scene analysis are based on low-level feature representations such as color- and texture-based features. Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and orderless Bag-of-Features (BoF) representations are the examples of mid-level approaches for remote sensing image classification. Recent trends for remote sensing and scene classification are focused on the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Keeping in view the success of CNN models, in this research, we aim to fine-tune ResNet50 by using network surgery and creation of network head along with the fine-tuning of hyperparameters. The learning of hyperparameters is tuned by using a linear decay learning rate scheduler known as piecewise scheduler. To tune the optimizer hyperparameter, Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) is used with the usage of weight learn and bias learn rate factor. Experiments and analysis are conducted on five different datasets, that is, UC Merced Land Use Dataset (UCM), RSSCN (the remote sensing scene classification image dataset), SIRI-WHU, Corel-1K, and Corel-1.5K. The analysis and competitive results exemplify that our proposed image classification-based model can classify the images in a more effective and efficient manner as compared to the state-of-the-art research </p>

                  <h3>Automated Face-Mask Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques</h3>
                  <p> The world is fighting with COVID-19 pandemic. There are so many essential equipment needed to fight against corona virus. One of such most essential is Face Mask. Firstly, face mask was not mandatory for everyone but as the day progressed scientists and doctor recommended everyone to wear face mask. Now to detect whether a person is wearing face mask or not we used face mask detection technique. Face Detection with Mask platform utilized artificial network to perceive if a person does/doesn’t wear a mask and also detect that person with mask that person belongs to record or not. The application can be associated with any current or new IP cameras to identify individuals with/without mask. Our goal is to identify whether the person on image/video stream is wearing a face mask or not. Identify using face detection whether that person belongs to saved record or not with the help of computer vision and deep learning. A face mask detection dataset consists of with mask and without mask images, we are going to use OpenCV to do real-time face detection from a live stream via our webcam. We will use the dataset to build COVID-19 “face detection with mask” with computer vision using Python. The proposed model can be integrated with surveillance cameras to impede the COVID-19 transmission by allowing the detection of people who are wearing masks not wearing face masks. The model is integration between deep learning and classical machine learning techniques. </p>

                  <h3>Automated Timetable Scheduler using GA </h3>
                  <p> The system that is being discussed in this thesis is a web application namely “Automated Timetable Scheduling” that will be able to address all the problems that have been identified in the existing manual system. This system will manage all the timetable related activities with highly effectiveness and efficiency. The manual system of preparing schedule in universities is very time consuming and usually ends up with various classes clashing either at same room or with same teachers having more than one class at a time. These are just due to common human errors which are very difficult to prevent. To overcome all these problems we propose to make an automated system. The system will take various inputs like details of university, courses, classrooms and teacher depending upon these inputs it will generate a possible schedule. Each teacher and student can view their timetable once they are finalized for a given semester but they can’t edit them.  </p>

                  <h3> OBE Canvas</h3>
                  <p> Current educational system in engineering institutions is moving towards Outcome-Based Education (OBE). There are nine OBE criterions those must be fulfilled to attain the certain level in OBE. The proposed system will help the faculty to manage the records of students about quizzes, assignments, projects, exams and paper creation and evaluation based on OBE. Proposed system will be a web-based portal for faculty, students, and administration. Each session of students will be managed in the system separately. There are specified number of courses for the students to be covered by each session to achieve Program Educational Objectives (PEOs). Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs) will be mapped to PEOs. Scheme of study that will be given to faculty, will have predefined Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) mapped with PLOs. There will be faculty and student corner in the system. Faculty member will be able to generate the OBE based report of individual student in which he/she will be able to examine the attained CLOs and PLOs by student. Based on these individual students reports Cohort report will be generated. In the student corner, student will have the privilege to only view their individual summary of attained and lagged CLOs, PLOs and PEOs. There will be authorities given to Continual Quality Improvement (CQI) director to monitor the overall OBE system progress based on OBE to make corrective actions. Resulting web-based portal will reduce the Clerical work burden from faculty to make them able to focus on study of students and innovational work for students. The system will make it easy for faculty to generate OBE based reports and award lists. </p>

                  <h3>Smart Electrometer</h3>
                  <p> Electricity is the basic need of every human being. As a lot of our daily work is dependent upon the electricity. So electricity departments are responsible to provide electricity to every human. We track the usage of electricity using the electric meter that how many units or electricity is consumed by a user. Electricity departments who provide electricity to the users, keep track of the utilized units and then bill to the user on the basis of those consumed units by a user. The electric meters being assigned to every consumer/user of electricity and then a meter reader (department’s employee) visit every single meter and then bills against the utilized units to the customer. Before this it was manual and the meter-reader have to visit every meter in every month for billing purpose. Smart Electro System (SESys.) is providing a digital solution to replace the manual billing system. This system integrated some digital devices with the digital meter (that is already in use) and those devices are sending the utilized units to the base station where admin can see those utilized units against a specific user in a web-interface. And then Admin (department’s employee) is able to generate the bill against that specific user. So this is a digital solution that is providing an ease mainly to the administration of the electricity department but generally to the consumers of electricity as well. The article describes the collection of the dataset of raw images of digital energy meters display, text detection and recognition of seven segment numerals from collected samples that may be helpful in reducing the cost of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). </p>

                  <p> E-tendering is carrying out tradition tendering process in an e-form using the internet. We
                     believe that to improve the performance of e-tender services over the internet, it is important to
                     not only measure the profit also completing the task in time account for plenty if a task is
                     aborted or discarded. If a tender tendering task is deemed to miss its deadline with no positive
                     semantic gain, a better choice should be one that can detect it and discard as soon as possible.
                     The result show that our approach outperforms our scheduling schemes in optimizing profit plenty

                  <h3> University Finder </h3>
                  <p>Currently students are facing many problems for searching of universities by reading
                     newspapers, search on internet and visit each university Site to find courses offered, their
                     criteria and schedule of admission. This is very difficult, time consuming and costly task. Some
                     time students are unable to get admission in their desire University due to lack of information
                     about degree program and time schedule. To overcome this problem, we will design an application to
                     facilitate students which will help users to find the suitable university as well as that will
                     match to their academic abilities. Our target audience for this kind of tool is primarily students.
                     Best time when students are not explicitly connected to an institution where they are able to
                     obtain guidance and can easily compare different universities from every aspect. We are looking
                     forward for ways to fill up the gap between students and institutes with the help of latest
                     technology which will be definitely improve the patterns of polishing someones skills by choosing
                     the right platform without asting the precious time of their life, instead investing it in a right
                     direction. Our application allows users to find the university by field of study, degree programs,
                     location, ranking and name. System will show the list of top universities that having information
                     about their offered courses, duration, admission schedule, pre-requisites, fee information and
                     address of every universities to the end users. Result will be filtered to the users for their best
