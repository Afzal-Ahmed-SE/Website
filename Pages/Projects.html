        <h3> E-Tender</h3>
        <p> E-tendering is carrying out tradition tendering process in an e-form using the internet. We believe that to improve the performance of e-tender services over the internet, it is important to not only measure the profit also completing the task in time account for plenty if a task is aborted or discarded. If a tender tendering task is deemed to miss its deadline with no positive semantic gain, a better choice should be one that can detect it and discard as soon as possible. The result show that our approach outperforms our scheduling schemes in optimizing profit plenty for consumers and provider, leading to high successful job execution and fair profit allocation.</p>

        <h3> University Finder </h3>
         <p>Currently students are facing many problems for searching of universities by reading
           newspapers, search on internet and visit each university Site to find courses offered, their criteria and schedule of admission. This is very difficult, time consuming and costly task. Some time students are unable to get admission in their desire University due to lack of information about degree program and time schedule. To overcome this problem, we will design an application to facilitate students which will help users to find the suitable university as well as that will match to their academic abilities. Our target audience for this kind of tool is primarily students. Best time when students are not explicitly connected to an institution where they are able to obtain guidance and can easily compare different universities from every aspect. We are looking forward for ways to fill up the gap between students and institutes with the help of latest technology which will be definitely improve the patterns of polishing someones skills by choosing the right platform without  asting the precious time of their life, instead investing it in a right direction. Our application allows users to find the university by field of study, degree programs, location, ranking and name. System will show the list of top universities that having information about their offered courses, duration, admission schedule, pre-requisites, fee information and address of every universities to the end users. Result will be filtered to the users for their best match.

        <h3> College Management System </h3>
          <p>This project is going to develop an Intranet College Management System (CMS) that is of significance to either a collage or a school. This system may be used for monitoring attendance for the college. Students as well as staffs logging in may also access or can be search any of the information regarding college. Attendance of the staff and students as well as marks of the students will be updated by staff. This system (CMS) is being developed for Asian college to maintain and facilitate easy access to information. For this the users must be registered with the system after which they can access as well as modify data as per the permissions given to them. CMS is an intranet based application that aims at providing information to all the levels of management within an organization. This system can be used as a knowledge/information management system for the college. For a registered student/staff (technical/Non-technical) can access the system to either upload or download some information from the database

        <h3> Online Election System</h3>
        <p> Election System is considered unfair for many reasons like scam votes, one person cast many votes, loss of votes due to inefficient ballet paper, difficulty of casting votes in polling stations, conducting election etc. Online Election System will help to overcome such kind of problems.
