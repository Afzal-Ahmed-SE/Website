          <h3> Context Aware Advertising: </h3>
          <p> Smart phone users spend more time on their mobile devices equipped with advanced features such as GPS, the Internet etc. It has attracted E-marketing companies to market their brands on mobile in as sense shift from E-marketing to M-marketing. Higher level enterprises have successfully captured huge marketplace using mobile advertising. But small and medium enterprises are still using the social media promotions without knowing customers location and any other contextual information. In this study, a context-aware Location Based Advertisement system (LBA system) is being proposed. LBA system uses the contextual information of the users to extract from a bunch of ads the most relevant ads. To validate the result field experiment is being conducted on ninety-five participants and eighteen thousand response on one hundred and ninety-three different ads uploaded by eighteen vendors of Mirpur city Azad Kashmir. Experiments show that location congruent advertisements are more relevant and attractive to the users then location in-congruent advertisements. A comparison with other techniques is being performed and the statistics suggest that the model proposed in this study is better in getting a positive response from users in sense of relevancy.

          <h3>Context-aware Advertisement in Rapid Transit Systems</h3>
          <p> The businesses of today believe on marketing oriented trend. Quality of marketing is equally important as the quality of the product and relevant metrics. Quality of Marketing depends on targeting the right person. Due to latest innovations in technology every aspect of human life adopted significant changes. In marketing also, significant changes in trends are considered. In this paper, we are presenting a model for advertisement using latest technology. This model is based on the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The target audience of the advertisement are rapid transit systems users. The model is designed using agent-based modeling (ABM) technique. We are using the Overview, Design and Details concept of ABM. This paper present a way to target right person for the advertisement. In this model, IoT provides the input data and the data is manipulated using pattern mining</p>

          <h3>  Agent-based Model for Smart Long Distance Transport System</h3>
          <p> Long distance transport is playing vital role in economic growth of countries. However, there is lack of systems being developed for monitoring and support of long route vehicles (LRV). A sustainable transport system with modern technologies is needed. We propose a model for the long distance vehicle transportation monitoring and support. Our model incorporates the distance vehicle transport mechanism through agent based modeling (ABM). This model constitutes design protocol of ABM called Overview, Design and Details (ODD). This model is proposed with the assumption that every category of agents is offering information as a service. We need federation of services through protocol for the communication between sensors and software components. This integration of services will be used for monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the route. Hence, this model provides an integration of services based on smart objects</p>

          <h3> A Survey Report on the Tools of Mutation Testing available in Market</h3>
          <p> Prevailing code coverage techniques in software testing such as condition coverage, branch coverage are thoroughness indicators, rather than the test suites capabilities to detect the fault. Mutation testing can be prospected as a fault based testing technique which can extent the efficiency of test cases for localizing the faults. Producing and running large number of mutants for the test cases is laborious and takes time as well. Therefore, mutation testing is not used as widely as it should in industry. Hence, an automated, fast and reliable tool for the same is required for the better performance is required. Various Mutation testing tools exists for the software industry. In this paper, various available tools  hich offer object-oriented operators are studied and based on the study; a comparison is made between these Mutation testing tools. An inference is made that all the available tools are language dependent or need to be configured differently for different languages to generate and run test cases. Comparative study reveals that most of available Mutation testing tools are in Java language and possess many important features while less number of tools is available for other languages like C, C++ and C#.
