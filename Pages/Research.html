          <h3> Context-Aware Services Using MANETs for Long-Distance Vehicular Systems: A Cognitive Agent-Based Model: </h3>
            <p>
            Long-distance transportation systems play an important role in economic growth. Yet, these systems are incurred with multifaceted delays and cost problems. The major incites affecting transportation systems are congestion, breakdowns, emergencies,
            and inclement weather. Scarcity of information about the environment also exacerbates travel problems. It is essential to employ monitoring and guidance that aid in making timely decisions through premediated information. This work aims to provide a
            flexible model for the long-distance transport system. The model is based on problems faced in long-distance transportation. Moreover, we examine the possible use of emerging Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for better trans-
            portation. The system dynamics study the problem at hand through cognitive agent-based modelling (ABM) concepts. The integrated model lays the rules to abate traffic delays. In this model, the distance travelled by vehicles is divided into sections using
            checkpoints. Every section is composed of different agents such as medical units, police stations, workshops, and petrol pumps. The vehicle shifts connection over the mobile ad hoc network (MANET) when enters or leaves a section. We used NetLogo for
            simulation of the model. A monitoring and guidance system is tested, and obtained results are analyzed by addressing problems causing delays. The guidance system helps vehicles to take optimal decisions for the time, congestion, and rests. The model can be
            used to improve decision-making for vehicles through premediated decisions. The proposed model can help to improve the efficiency of the transportation systems by reducing travel time.

          <h3> Satellite and Scene Image Classification Based on Transfer Learning and Fine Tuning of ResNet50 </h3>
          <p> 
            Image classification has gained lot of attention due to its application in different computer vision tasks such as remote sensing, scene analysis, surveillance, object detection, and image retrieval. The primary goal of image classification is to assign the class
            labels to images according to the image contents. The applications of image classification and image analysis in remote sensing are important as they are used in various applied domains such as military and civil fields. Earlier approaches for remote sensing
            images and scene analysis are based on low-level feature representations such as color- and texture-based features. Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and orderless Bag-of-Features (BoF) representations are the examples of mid-level
            approaches for remote sensing image classification. Recent trends for remote sensing and scene classification are focused on the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Keeping in view the success of CNN models, in this research, we aim to fine-tune
            ResNet50 by using network surgery and creation of network head along with the fine-tuning of hyperparameters. The learning of hyperparameters is tuned by using a linear decay learning rate scheduler known as piecewise scheduler. To tune the optimizer
            hyperparameter, Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) is used with the usage of weight learn and bias learn rate factor. Experiments and analysis are conducted on five different datasets, that is, UC Merced Land Use Dataset (UCM), RSSCN
            (the remote sensing scene classification image dataset), SIRI-WHU, Corel-1K, and Corel-1.5K. The analysis and competitive results exemplify that our proposed image classification-based model can classify the images in a more effective and efficient
            manner as compared to the state-of-the-art research

          <h3> Context Aware Advertising: </h3>
          <p> Smart phone users spend more time on their mobile devices equipped with advanced features such as GPS, the Internet etc. It has attracted E-marketing companies to market their brands on mobile in as sense shift from E-marketing to M-marketing. Higher level enterprises have successfully captured huge marketplace using mobile advertising. But small and medium enterprises are still using the social media promotions without knowing customers location and any other contextual information. In this study, a context-aware Location Based Advertisement system (LBA system) is being proposed. LBA system uses the contextual information of the users to extract from a bunch of ads the most relevant ads. To validate the result field experiment is being conducted on ninety-five participants and eighteen thousand response on one hundred and ninety-three different ads uploaded by eighteen vendors of Mirpur city Azad Kashmir. Experiments show that location congruent advertisements are more relevant and attractive to the users then location in-congruent advertisements. A comparison with other techniques is being performed and the statistics suggest that the model proposed in this study is better in getting a positive response from users in sense of relevancy.

          <h3>Context-aware Advertisement in Rapid Transit Systems</h3>
          <p> The businesses of today believe on marketing oriented trend. Quality of marketing is equally important as the quality of the product and relevant metrics. Quality of Marketing depends on targeting the right person. Due to latest innovations in technology every aspect of human life adopted significant changes. In marketing also, significant changes in trends are considered. In this paper, we are presenting a model for advertisement using latest technology. This model is based on the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). The target audience of the advertisement are rapid transit systems users. The model is designed using agent-based modeling (ABM) technique. We are using the Overview, Design and Details concept of ABM. This paper present a way to target right person for the advertisement. In this model, IoT provides the input data and the data is manipulated using pattern mining</p>

          <h3>  Agent-based Model for Smart Long Distance Transport System</h3>
          <p> Long distance transport is playing vital role in economic growth of countries. However, there is lack of systems being developed for monitoring and support of long route vehicles (LRV). A sustainable transport system with modern technologies is needed. We propose a model for the long distance vehicle transportation monitoring and support. Our model incorporates the distance vehicle transport mechanism through agent based modeling (ABM). This model constitutes design protocol of ABM called Overview, Design and Details (ODD). This model is proposed with the assumption that every category of agents is offering information as a service. We need federation of services through protocol for the communication between sensors and software components. This integration of services will be used for monitoring and tracking of vehicles on the route. Hence, this model provides an integration of services based on smart objects</p>

          <h3> A Survey Report on the Tools of Mutation Testing available in Market</h3>
          <p> Prevailing code coverage techniques in software testing such as condition coverage, branch coverage are thoroughness indicators, rather than the test suites capabilities to detect the fault. Mutation testing can be prospected as a fault based testing technique which can extent the efficiency of test cases for localizing the faults. Producing and running large number of mutants for the test cases is laborious and takes time as well. Therefore, mutation testing is not used as widely as it should in industry. Hence, an automated, fast and reliable tool for the same is required for the better performance is required. Various Mutation testing tools exists for the software industry. In this paper, various available tools  hich offer object-oriented operators are studied and based on the study; a comparison is made between these Mutation testing tools. An inference is made that all the available tools are language dependent or need to be configured differently for different languages to generate and run test cases. Comparative study reveals that most of available Mutation testing tools are in Java language and possess many important features while less number of tools is available for other languages like C, C++ and C#.
